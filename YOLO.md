### YOLO v4

[Intro](https://paperswithcode.com/method/yolov4)

YOLOv4 is a one-stage object detection model that improves on YOLOv3 with several bags of tricks and modules introduced in the literature. The components section below details the tricks and modules used.

This article is a step by step guide to make the custom object detection using yolo v4. Training the yolo in colab gives the advantage of utilizing the free gpu provided by google.When i started to train my project on colab i stumbled upon many things. Through this article i hope i could clear the path for many.If you are novice it could be a bit overwhelming but make a checklist containing each step and focus on completing one at a time.The links to the papers and references are given at the end.
